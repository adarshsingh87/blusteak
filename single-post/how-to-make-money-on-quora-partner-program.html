				How to Make Money on Quora Partner Program? 4 Easy Tricks to Earn More
				by Asking Questions on Quora
			</div>
			<p>
				You might all have at least once got an insightful answer from
				<a href="https://www.quora.com/">Quora</a>
				. Like that it provides solutions to questions ranging across all sorts
				of topics you can think of.
			</p>
			<p>
				Well, I have been an active quora user for the last 4 years. I would
				sometimes write answers to some questions to which I thought I could
				provide value.
			</p>
			<p>
				One day I got a message from quora saying that I am invited to something
				known as "
				<a href="https://www.quora.com/q/quorapartnersupdates">
					Quora Partner Program
				</a>
				". Basically, from now onwards I would get paid for asking questions in
				Quora.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog7-1.webp" alt="img" />
			<div class="sub-heading">How to join Quora partner program?</div>
			<p>
				<b>
					<a
						href="https://www.quora.com/How-does-Quoras-Partner-Program-work-2"
					>
						According to many sources, your content needs to be viewed by more
						than 100,000 times
					</a>
					in the platform to get the invitation to join the program in 2020.
				</b>
				Although I got invited when I only had somewhere around 55,000 views.
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading">Is Quora Partner Program legit?</div>
			<p>
				For me, it is quite legit this far. But I have read some articles saying
				they got
				<a
					href="https://medium.com/@AntonioKowatsch/the-quora-partner-program-is-a-scam-9026c675cc7e"
				>
					kicked out of the program when it was time for the payment
				</a>
				without any particular reason. My opinion is to go for it since Quora is
				a trusted brand and you can bank on them.
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading">
				How to earn more from Quora Partner Program?
			</div>
			<p>
				Now, you might have already got invited to the partner program, but
				might not be getting your targeted revenue from the program. Here are
				some suggestions that I learned from my experience to increase the
				chances of earning more from your questions:
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				1) Have an Idea about how the program basically works - Take the
				perspective of the advertisers:
			</div>
			<p>
				Where does the money come from? Advertisers pay quora to put up ads of
				their products or services in between the answers to your questions. It
				might be in the form of simple text ads, promoted answers or any other
				forms.
			</p>
			<p>
				They have this option of
				<a
					href="https://www.jainishshah.in/what-are-keywords-in-digital-marketing-seo/"
				>
					targeting "Keywords"
				</a>
				or topics to which only the ad will be displayed.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, if a hosting provider is doing a campaign in quora, they
				might only put up ads of their service among the answers to questions
				which may have the keyword "Website" or "Hosting". This is done in order
				to get the attention of only those people who are interested in the
				topic of website building since they have a higher chance of purchasing
				the hosting services.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hence, if you have these kinds of a keyword in your question they will
				attract more ads from businesses. Then you'll end up getting way more ad
				impressions for your question.
			</p>
			<p>Here's something I did to prove this:</p>
			<img
				loading="lazy"
				src="../assets/blogs/blog7-2.webp"
				alt="img"
				class="sub-img"
			/>
			<p>
				The above question has the keyword "Webinar" in it. Hence it brought me
				$0.08 from just 414 answer views. Targeted ads are costlier, thus more
				money for me too.
			</p>
			<img
				loading="lazy"
				src="../assets/blogs/blog7-3.webp"
				alt="img"
				class="sub-img"
			/>
			<p>
				In this question, there is no particular keyword that any brand may
				target. Hence I got only $0.05 from 48,342 views! No advertisers, no
				money!
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				2) A lot of traffic comes from Google. Take advantage of it.
			</div>
			<p>
				If you type in any query in Google, the chances are that there will be a
				quora question in the first page of results. This is because of trust
				Google has for the site.
			</p>
			<p>
				Think of what new things are people going to search on google. You can
				use
				<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US">
					Google trends to analyse this
				</a>
				. After taking up a topic, curate a simple question phrasing it the way
				you think people are going to search for it on Google.
			</p>
			<p>Here's an example question I asked:</p>
			<img
				loading="lazy"
				src="../assets/blogs/blog7-4.webp"
				alt="img"
				class="sub-img"
			/>
			<p>
				This is almost a perfect question. I asked this when Covid-19 started
				hitting the stock markets hard.
				<a
					href="https://www.quora.com/Will-the-stock-market-recover-from-this-blow-due-to-coronavirus-Covid-19"
				>
					hitting the stock markets hard. Now this question ranks on the first
					page of Google Search hitting the stock markets hard.
				</a>
				. Also since it has the keyword "Stock market" in it, there are lots of
				ads displayed under it.
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				3) If you want to get millions of views for the answers to your
				questions, it has to go viral inside the Quora community.
			</div>
			<p>
				Yes, if you are looking for sheer numbers, you got to ask really
				interesting questions to which you may get awesome answers from hardcore
				quora users. This is going to help your question get tens and thousands
				of views inside the quora community.
				<br />
				<br />
				Here's an example:
			</p>
			<img
				loading="lazy"
				src="../assets/blogs/blog7-5.webp"
				alt="img"
				class="sub-img"
			/>
			<p>Look at the number of views for the answer:</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog7-6.webp" alt="img" />
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				4) Some basic checklists you might want to do before posting a new
				question:
			</div>
			<p>- Select only the right topics</p>
			<img
				loading="lazy"
				src="../assets/blogs/blog7-7.webp"
				alt="img"
				class="sub-img"
			/>
			<p>
				As you can see, since the question is about Mother's day, I'm skipping
				"Surprise" and some other topics that I think is irrelevant.
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				- Ask people who answer a lot
			</p>
			<img
				loading="lazy"
				src="../assets/blogs/blog7-8.webp"
				alt="img"
				class="sub-img"
			/>
			<p>
				I'm only selecting those people who answer a lot. Carefully choose only
				active users in quora to fill that 25 request quota that quora offer per
				day.
				<br />
				<br />
				- Check whether the same question has been asked by someone else.
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">Conclusion:</div>
			<p>
				It's not easy, but if you make a plan and stick to a schedule of asking
				questions with the above-mentioned point of view, you are going to
				create a new passive income stream for yourselves.
