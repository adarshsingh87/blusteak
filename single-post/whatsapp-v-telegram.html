      [Case Study] WhatsApp vs Telegram: for Business Marketing

      <br>
      To have real-time talks with your customers,<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/258749/most-popular-global-mobile-messenger-apps/" target="_"> WhatsApp and Telegram are among the most popular messaging apps.</a> Telegram
      is known for its feature-rich experience. WhatsApp, on the other hand, boasts of a mammoth user base.
      <br>
      <br>
      But WhatsApp or Telegram; which one is better for business marketing? Well, it can be overwhelming to experiment with
      each app and find where to focus your efforts.
      <br>
      <br>
      So, in this article, I am writing about my experience with both WhatsApp and Telegram. But first, let’s see how their
      features compare:
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="sub-heading-big">Feature comparison: WhatsApp vs Telegram</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class="sub-heading">Platforms</span>
      <br>
      WhatsApp has native apps for Android and iOS mobiles. To use it on PC, you have to open WhatsApp web on your browser.
      Also, the web version needs to be connected to WhatsApp on your mobile.
      <br>
      <br>
      Telegram, on the other hand, has apps for Android, iOS, Windows, Mac OS as well as Linux.
      <br />
      <br />
      <span class="sub-heading">Groups</span>
      <br>
      WhatsApp allows you to add 256 people to a group. You can also create private broadcasts to send messages to several
      people (up to 256) at once.
      <br>
      <br>
      In Telegram groups, you can add up to 200,000 people. These groups can be public or private. Telegram even has public
      channels to broadcast messages to subscribers. These can have unlimited subscribers.
      <br />
      <br />
      <span class="sub-heading">Group calls</span>
      <br>
      WhatsApp allows group audio calls and video calls. It also has a “low data” mode to reduce the amount of data used while
      calls.
      <br>
      <br>
      But Telegram isn’t offering calls in groups, yet.
      <br />
      <br />
      <span class="sub-heading">File sharing</span>
      <br>
      WhatsApp allows file-sharing of up to 100 MB in size.
      <br>
      <br>
      But with Telegram, you can share files up to 2 GB large. Also, the files are stored on the cloud, instead of on the
      device itself.
      <br />
      <br />
      <span class="sub-heading">Bots</span>
      <br>
      WhatsApp provides the chatbot feature to interact and engage with your customers.
      <br>
      <br>
      But Telegram has official and third-party chatbots to perform a variety of tasks. You can create quizzes, conduct polls,
      and even automate sharing posts from different social networks.
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <span class="sub-heading-big">WhatsApp and Telegram business marketing – My experience</span>
    <p>
      Now, you can see that Telegram has many features to market a business. But would it be better than WhatsApp for you?
    </p>
    <div>
      <div><img src="../assets/case-studies/Screenshot 2021-04-02 230217.png" alt="image" loading="lazy" class="tttt"></div>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Well, I started a WhatsApp group about a year ago. I wanted to form a community of marketers.
        <br>
        <br>
        Later, as the group was reaching its limit of 256 members, I ran a poll. It was to decide whether to create another
        WhatsApp group as an extension or to move to a Telegram group.
        <br>
        <br>
        73% of participants wanted to move to Telegram. And I created one there too.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here’s my experience with both
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Why is Telegram better for business marketing?</b> <br>
        Telegram groups can have more members than WhatsApp groups. So, you can have a bigger connected community if you build it through Telegram, instead of
        WhatsApp.
        <br>
        <br>
        And I found I have better admin controls in a Telegram group. I could delete a message sent by other members of the
        group. In WhatsApp, admins can't delete spammy, hateful or other kinds of messages sent by members.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then, Telegram also allows you to pin an important announcement to the top of your group.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Why is WhatsApp better for business marketing?</b> <br>
        Telegram sure has some better features than WhatsApp, suitable for business marketing. But WhatsApp has something else –
        a huge user-base.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I used to share my WhatsApp group’s link on LinkedIn and Twitter, over 30-40 people joined every time. But in case
        of the Telegram group, only about 20 people join it when I share its link. Also, people are engaging better in my
        WhatsApp group than Telegram. The reason might be that everyone is used to WhatsApp; they're familiar with it.
        <br>
        <br>
        So, if you're looking to have an active and engaging community, you can't ignore WhatsApp.
        <br>
        <br>
        WhatsApp also has Stories. You can use that feature to promote your products and services among your phone contacts.
        <br>

    <p>
      <span class="sub-heading-big">Conclusion</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      With my experience, I can say Telegram can be helpful to promote your business to a wider audience. No doubt. You can
      keep more people updated at once.
      <br>
      <br>
      But if you want to have an engaged bunch, WhatsApp should be your go-to instant messenger. WhatsApp also allows for
      business profiles. Those have added features and automation to keep your customers well-informed.
