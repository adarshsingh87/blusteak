      How to Use Quora Ads to Promote Your Business?

      Quora has been a popular platform among businesses and marketers for various reasons.
      You can find a new audience, drive referral traffic to your website, and build reputable brand
      awareness. But have you tried Quora Ads to promote your business?
      <br>
      <br>
      Yes, you can set up different ads like promoting answers which can benefit your business.
      These answers can build trust among your audience. Many <a href="https://www.karooya.com/blog/ppcchat-all-things-quora-advertising-23-january-2019/" target="_">businesses are leveraging Quora Ads</a> to improve their traffic. And I tried the same for Blusteak Media.
      <br>
      <br>
      So, in this article, I’m explaining what Quora Promoted Answers are. I’ll also tell you how to
      use these paid promotions for your business.

      <span class="sub-heading-big">What are Promoted Answers in Quora?</span>

      </div>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Promoted Answers are an ad type. You can use
        it to push an answer for better visibility in the
        audience feed. These answers appear, along
        with the question, like normal Q&As but they
        have “Promoted” mentioned on their top.
        <br>
        <br>
        You can promote any answer on Quora. It can
        be a detailed answer you wrote about your
        services or a positive product experience written
        by a Quora user.
        <br>
        <br>
        Quora Promoted Answers can bring substantial
        results to your business, when you do it in the
        right way.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="sub-heading-big">How effective are Quora Promoted Answers?</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        As always, “It depends.” But in any case,
        <a href="https://business.quora.com/Promote-your-Answers-on-Quora" target="_">Promoted Answers</a> can be a great way to stack
        some traffic and leads.
        <br>
        <br>
        For the last few days, I have been testing the Promoted Answers ad type for Blusteak. Have
        looked for answers which mentioned Blusteak Media and promoted them among my
        audience. Those were short-term campaigns, but the promoted answers gathered a good
        reach within that time. Check the image below.

    <p>
      <br>
      <br>
      Yes, of course, the reach will vary on how interested people are in knowing about your
      industry. The campaign success also depends on the way you filter the demographics.

        <img src="../assets/blogs/quora-promote-answer.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy" class="tttt">
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        To use Quora ads, you&#39;ll need to
        create an ad account.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now, when you create a new ad
        campaign, select “Promote an
        answer” format from the list. Name
        the campaign and insert the link to
        the answer you want to promote.
        This can be your answer or by some
        other Quora user.
        <br>
        <br>
        Next, select the target audience and
        target location for the campaign.
        <br>
        <br>
        Quora offers different audience
        targeting options like Contextual
        targeting and Behavioural targeting. 
        For the “kuber” promo, for example, I selected
        Contextual targeting. And I targeted
        topics like Social Media Strategy,
        Giveaways and Instagram
        Marketing. These were relevant to
        the question being answered.
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <img src="../assets/blogs/quora-contextual-targeting.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy" class="tttt">
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        For target location, I went ahead with
        the countries I wanted the audience
        and potential clients from. You can
        even choose to exclude certain
        locations for the selected campaign.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="sub-heading-big">How to get the most out of Promoted Answers?</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        When it comes to promoting
        answers, you shouldn’t just boost
        any. Not all answers bring favourable
        results. Promote an answer as per
        your goal – awareness, conversion
        or traffic.
        <br>
        <br>
        For that, select a relevant question or FAQ that you think will interest your customers. You
        can even post FAQs if not asked already on Quora. You can do this anonymously. Then,
        answer the question yourself or invite your loyal customers to write about your services.
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <img src="../assets/blogs/quora-location-targeting.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy" class="tttt">
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Now, choose high-quality answers to promote your business.
        <br>
        <br>
        Keep in mind: A suitable answer is the one which provides the best solution to the question.
        It doesn’t look promotional or spammy.
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      <span class="sub-heading-big">Conclusion</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      Quora Promoted Answers ad type can bring highly qualified leads and relevant traffic to your
      business website. These answers appear alongside other answers. And except for
      “Promoted” mentioned, they look no different from the regular questions and answers.
