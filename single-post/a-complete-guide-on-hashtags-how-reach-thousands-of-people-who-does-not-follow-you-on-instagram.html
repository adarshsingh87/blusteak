				A Complete Guide on Hashtags - How to Reach Thousands of People Who Does
				Not Follow You on Instagram
			</div>
			<p>
				Hello all, if you have come here, probably you are looking forward to
				finding how to get thousands of reach for your small Instagram account
				through hashtags.

				<br />
				<br />
				Yes, in fact, you have come to the right place. I have been looking for
				the answer for more than a year now. Read all there is to read about
				hashtags, all most all the explanatory videos there are, used most of
				the ”magical” Instagram hashtag hack tools

				<br />
				<br />
				Nothing worked.

				<br />
				<br />
				Hence I started to experiment with what my guts told me. Initially,
				again some of the things I tried didn’t work. Then for the last 4-5
				months, I got a hack that has been working wonders for me. Ie, almost
				90% posts that I post with the ‘Hashtag Trick’ that I use ends up
				getting at least 3 times more reach than the total number of followers
				that my account has.

				<br />
				<br />
				This is how much followers we have:
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog11-1.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>This is the number of reaches that we nowadays get from Hashtags</p>
			<img
				loading="lazy"
				src="../assets/blogs/blog11-2.webp"
				alt="img"
				class="sub-img"
			/>
			<p>Getting into the hack:</p>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				1) You Need Content that is Relevant.
			</div>
			<p>
				Let me warn something. This trick or another trick in the whole world
				will not work if the content is not good enough. Yes, I know sometimes
				we get this creativity block. Everyone goes through that. And to solve
				that you need a topic to start brainstorming from right?

				<br />
				<br />
				For that, I recommend always going for the topic that is trending right
				now on the web. From my experience, anything that is relevant to the day
				or the times has multiple times more potential than any regular content
				that you’re going to push out.
				<br />
				<br />

				You might ask, How the hell am I going to find those topics?
				<br />
				<br />

				<a href="https://trends.google.com/">
					The answer lies in a tool called Google trends by Google.
				</a>
				All you need is to adjust to your country and it will show you what’s
				going on there.
				<br />
				<br />

				I am going to guide you through an example.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog11-3.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>
				As you can see Robert Downey Jr is trending now. (Probably it's his
				birthday tomorrow)

				<br />
				<br />
				I’ll take that for consideration and will show you how I’ll be creating
				hashtags for that topic.

				<br />
				<br />
				And one more tip, always go for minimal designs like this:
			</p>
			<img
				loading="lazy"
				src="../assets/blogs/blog11-4.webp"
				alt="img"
				class="sub-img"
			/>
			<p>
				Or if you’re bad at designing or you don’t have a designer with you, you
				can always go on to create memes out of it like these:
			</p>
			<img
				loading="lazy"
				src="../assets/blogs/blog11-5.webp"
				alt="img"
				class="sub-img"
			/>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">2) Number of Hashtags</div>
			<p>
				Now getting onto hashtags, to start with let us put a maximum limit of
				hashtags we will be using. I always try to keep it in between 8 to 10 so
				as to not to make the post super spammy.
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				3) Where to hunt for Hashtags?
			</div>
			<p>
				No. I never use any third-party apps for getting hashtags. All you need
				is the beautiful little search bar that is natively
				<a href="https://www.instagram.com/">built-in your Instagram app.</a>
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				4) Selection criteria for Hashtags
			</div>
			<p>
				Now, this is the most important part. Never go for big hashtags, ie
				hashtags that have got a number of posts in it more than 400k. Like this
				one:
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog11-6.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>Also, don’t go below 20k like this one:</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog11-7.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>
				So the sweet point is to select hashtags which have the number of posts
				between 30k to 400k. Like this one:
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog11-8.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>
				The reason I do this is that I want my posts to be in the hashtags page
				for at least half-an-hour, which will not be the case for a hashtag with
				10million posts.

				<br />
				<br />
				These are the hashtags on the topic Robert Downey that qualifies the
				criteria:

				<br />
				<br />
				#robertdowneyjunior#avengers3#tonystarkedit#robertdowneyjredit#ironmanedit#ironmanfans#avengersassemble#marvelfan
				#yelenabelova
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				5) The Relevance of the Selected Hashtags.
			</div>
			<p>
				Don’t use #-Ronaldo in a post that has nothing to do with Ronaldo or
				Football. Instagram will find out you’re spamming hashtags and will cut
				the reach.
				<br />
				<br />
				All the hashtags should be super relevant to the post’s content.
				<br />
				<br />
				Among the selected hashtags this hashtag doesn’t fit in well.
				#yelenabelova Hence removing it.
				<br />
				<br />
				Therefore this is our final list:
				<br />
				<br />
				#robertdowneyjunior #avengers3 #tonystarkedit #robertdowneyjredit
				#ironmanedit #ironmanfans #avengersassemble #marvelfan

				<br />
				<br />
				Now I hope you got an idea on how to select hashtags to get lots of
				reaches and hopefully lots of likes and followers too!
				<br />
				<br />
				Good luck :)
