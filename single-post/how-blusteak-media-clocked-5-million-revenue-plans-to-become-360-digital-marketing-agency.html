				How Blusteak Media clocked 5 million revenue; Plans to Become 360¬∞
				Digital Marketing Agency.
			</div>
			<p>
				From our childhood, me and my brother always had a dream about making a
				mark in the world, and to pursue our dreams so that we can influence the
				lives of many. But, we had no idea, our mind was blank except for the
				urge to do something of our own.
				<br />
				By the time Facebook became a thing in India and Orkut became history,
				even though we had no internet connection in our homes, we would go to
				the nearest cafe to surf through the net, and especially really enjoy
				all the internet "memes" thoroughly. Inspired by many of the much loved
				meme pages in Facebook, we decided to start one of our own. We initially
				tried to build up several pages but everything failed miserably, but our
				perseverance gave us the energy to give it one more shot. This time
				fortune was on our side, the last two portals that we began ended up
				getting more that 5.5 Million followers. We managed and generated
				sufficient income from those sources for about 3 years. All these time
				me & my brother were doing our schooling & college degrees.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog26.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>
				We decided that we needed our own platform or an app to scale and
				stabilize the business, By that time apart from us brothers, Dixon Alex
				also made it into the list of cofounders. We then together developed and
				launched an app called Dudeapp, which was a UGC segregation platform. In
				the initial month it saw itself grow into a user base of more than
				50,000. The app was covered by several news outlets and gave us
				tremendous exposure. Unfortunately, due to technical disabilities we had
				to shut it down soon.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog26-1.png" alt="img" />
			<p>
				We got the opportunity to learn in depth with tremendous exposure on
				practical experience on social media platforms. At that time, we knew
				that we have developed a set of skills that is in huge demand for the
				business world. So decided to start a social media agency which was one
				among the first of its kind in Kerala, we named it Blusteak Media.
				<br />
				We had no experience in business development or in how to build up real
				world professional connections. We had only a very few amount of money
				left with us since all the other revenue sources has been shutdown.
				Hence we had only one shot at marketing our company and if it did not
				hit the spot, that would mark the end of it and we would have been
				forced to quit and join some other day jobs to sustain our daily needs.
				<br />
				While we were brainstorming ideas to effectively market the startup to
				businesses, one of our friends, Dimple Meera Jom contacted us and shared
				her idea of conducting a 1 day workshop on Social Media Marketing to
				students and businesses. We thought it out and realised that, this
				workshop could help us connect with brands and would give our startup a
				quick boost. Hence we conducted the one day workshop ‚ÄúSwipe Up‚Äù.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog26-2.jpg" alt="img" />
			<p>
				Just as we thought, it turned out that one of the main sponsors of Swipe
				Up was interested to test out digital marketing for their brand. After a
				couple of meetings, we were able to land our very first client and their
				budget was enough for us to run the company and to stabilize it by
				hiring new team members.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog26-3.jpg" alt="img" />
			<p>
				Several other brands soon associated with us we started rolling out
				effective online result oriented campaigns.We then moved to a new
				multi-storied office which was situated even closer to the city of
				Kottayam. Some of the great achievements we pulled off was to grow the
				sales of an Ayurvedic product 600% compared to the sales statistics
				before us through our well executed e-commerce integration. By this time
				we had managed to bag half a crore revenue that year.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog26-4.jpg" alt="img" />
			<p>
				It was time to level our game up, we plan to become Kerala‚Äôs biggest 360
				degree digital exclusive marketing agency by 2020. Hence we currently
				accompany an in house production team for creating social media friendly
				video ads. Apart from production, what makes us stand out from the crowd
				is our unique marketing service protocol, known as ‚ÄúStrive Campaigns‚Äù.
				We have been running beta Strive campaigns and it continues to outweigh
				all other campaigns in terms of results.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog26-5.png" alt="img" />
			<p>
				Pushing much deeper into online marketing so as to provide maximum value
				for our clients, we are developing our own wing for technology
				integrated marketing activities such as Augmented Reality based
				interactions and chatbot communication. This will enable data collection
				and Machine learning based data processing methodologies for our
				clients.
				<br />
				To summarise about our organisation, We are passionate about creatively
				passing on the message of an organisation to the masses which will, in
				turn, help the audience to choose better & worthwhile products and
				services.
