				Healthcare WhatsApp Chatbot Use Cases - For Hospitals and Clinics
			</div>
			<p>
				Given the growth in the health care industry, it becomes difficult for
				the service providers to maintain a top level of customer satisfaction &
				accessibility but with the use of technology & AI, the industry can
				deliver high-quality services to its customers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Monotonous & repetitive tasks can be automated with the use of bots.
				Looking at the vast user base of
				<a
					href="https://fortunly.com/statistics/whatsapp-statistics#gref"
					target="_"
				>
					WhatsApp with 1.5 billion users in 180 countries makes it the most
					popular messaging app.
				</a>
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog4-1.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>
				WhatsApp Chatbots allows businesses to leverage the pre-existing user
				base of the app. Chatbots acts as a virtual assistant for the user to
				deliver personalized services with maximum speed. We can also train
				chatbots to understand human behaviour, allowing users to have a
				customized experience. More so they enable round-the-clock service
				delivery, helping the industry to foster the relationship with their
				customers & build a trustworthy brand.
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				Ways in which WhatsApp Chatbots can boost the Health Care industry:
			</div>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				1. Handle multiple chats at the same time
			</div>
			<p>
				Ever wondered how many sales opportunities get missed by a specific
				hospital just because they didnâ€™t have enough executives for answering
				customer questions and the customer moved to a different hospital? All
				those potential sales opportunities can now be capitalized on by the
				hospitals resulting in higher revenue for the hospital.
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				2. Send prescriptions, health records and bills via Whatsapp
			</div>
			<p>
				Chatbots can aid Hospitals & Clinics to deliver a personalized
				experience by enabling medicine reminders to individuals as per their
				prescription. Chatbots are also competent to track blood sugar levels,
				body weight & menstrual cycle in women that helps the user to stay
				aligned with their health goals and track their progress. This
				record-keeping and reminder feature of bots help promote a healthy
				lifestyle amongst people.
			</p>
			<img src="../assets/blogs/blod4-2.webp" alt="img" loading="lazy" />
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				3. Setup automated response to FAQs:
			</div>
			<p>
				Bots allow customer service scalability with efficient time management.
				Most people call customer service executives to
				<a
					href="https://zolainteractive.com/frequently-asked-questions-the-content-you-shouldnt-ignore/"
					target="_"
				>
					ask basic FAQ questions
				</a>
				or to book an appointment with the doctors. Bots can easily manage such
				activities, reducing the operational cost of hiring customer service
				executives. By 2022, Chabot-related tax savings in the healthcare sector
				are expected to reach $3.6 billion annually, having risen from just $2.8
				million in 2017.
			</p>
			<img src="../assets/blogs/blod4-3.webp" alt="img" loading="lazy" />
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				4. Gives privacy for the patient:
			</div>
			<p>
				<a
					href="https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/almost-everywhere-world-mental-illness-taboo-subject"
					target="_"
				>
					Mental Health continues to be a taboo and few people like to talk
					about it.
				</a>
				WhatsApp Chatbots can help the victims of mental health to get required
				medical support by connecting him/her to the right doctor. People may
				also find Chatbots easy to use as it replaces the concerns related to
				stereotyping, which is a reason that restricts people from getting the
				required medical help/counselling for their mental health.
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				5. 24x7 operational service:
			</div>
			<p>
				Irrespective of what time of the day it is or where the person is
				located,
				<a href="https://www.sofbang.com/chatbots/" target="_">
					WhatsApp Chatbots can help in the instant addressal of customer
					concerns
				</a>
				resulting in increased customer satisfaction & brand loyalty. This helps
				health care providers to satisfy their customers need for immediate
				service delivery.
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				6. Compliments the new normal:
			</div>
			<p>
				The COVID 19 pandemic that the world is facing right now has changed the
				way people live. Social distancing norms have become the new normal.
				There are prime chances of
				<a
					href="https://discover.bot/bot-talk/coronavirus-chatbots/"
					target="_"
				>
					people avoiding physically visiting places & prefer basic medical
					treatment
				</a>
				to happen while they are at the comfort of their houses. WhatsApp
				chatbots play a major role in this as bots can be trained to diagnose
				symptoms in an individual based on their input & suggest required
				treatment.
			</p>
			<img src="../assets/blogs/blod4-4.webp" alt="img" loading="lazy" />
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				7. Recommending the right Doctor & booking an appointment:
			</div>
			<p>
				Chatbots can help the user locate the right doctor by investigating the
				availability & accessibility of the doctor after recording the symptoms
				of the user. Users can also use chatbots to schedule their appointment
				with their preferred doctor as per their convenience, which ultimately
				saves the time of the user.
			</p>
			<img src="../assets/blogs/blod4-5.webp" alt="img" loading="lazy" />
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				8. Storing the health history of patients digitally which are easily
				accessible to the doctor and the patient:
			</div>
			<p>
				Chatbots can help user and doctors to have a centralized database that
				records the medical history & prescriptions of individuals, which either
				of them can access. This centralized information helps doctors to study
				the medical history of their patients before attending them, enhancing
				the quality of service delivery.
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading">Conclusion:</div>
			<p>
				Whatsapp chatbot opens up unlimited possibilities for scaling up and
				automating patient interactions in the healthcare sector. Using it
				smartly in a way that it increases user interface will surely help in
				reducing the friction for a patient to interact with the hospital.
