				10 Golden Rules of Advertising That I learned From the 'Father of
				Advertising'​ - David Ogilvy.
			</div>
			<p>
				As I run an
				<a href="http://blusteak.com/">online marketing agency</a>
				, I have been on the lookout for a good book to learn some new
				principles of advertisements so that I can start applying it for our
				clients.
				<br />
				<br />
				Then I came across David Ogilvy, founder of
				<a href="http://ogivly.com/">Ogilvy & Mather</a>
				(One of the biggest Ad agencies in the world) who has led the execution
				of many iconic campaigns which has even saved an entire country (Porto
				Rico) from an
				<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/03/business/media/03adco.html">
					economic meltdown.
				</a>
				<br />
				<br />
				I was curious whether he had written any books sharing his knowledge and
				I stumbled upon one of his books -
				<a href="https://amzn.to/34sCnFM">Confessions of an Advertising Man</a>
				. I decided to give it a shot.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog22.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>
				These are the highlight points that I learned newly about, that I now
				like to consider as golden rules for advertisements:
				<br />
				<br />
				<span class="sub-heading sub-heading-big">
					1) The purpose of a copy is to sell.
				</span>
				<br />
				<br />
				Ogilvy says that there are three kinds of copies:
				<br />
				a) One that the client approves.
				<br />
				b) One that gets famous in the advertising industry.
				<br />
				c) One that doesn't drive attention to itself but sells the product.
				<br />
				He advises us to always go for the third one, ie, the copy written about
				the product should not drive attention to itself but should drive the
				attention of the consumer to the product in a manner that he/she feels
				the urge to buy the product.
				<br />
				<br />
				<span class="sub-heading sub-heading-big">
					2) Never write an advertisement that you wouldn't want your own family
					to read.
				</span>
				<br />
				<br />
				This one is self-explanatory, ie, think of the audience just the way as
				your family members. It should be honest. Good products can be sold with
				honest advertising. If you lie to your customers, either the law will
				get you or the customer is not going to buy from you again.
				<br />
				<br />
				<span class="sub-heading sub-heading-big">3) Give the facts.</span>
				<br />
				<br />
				Don't shy away from providing the customer with facts about your
				products/services.
				<br />
				<br />
				The more facts that you show about the product, the more information the
				customer receives, which increases the chance to make a sale.
				<br />
				<br />
				For example, Ogilvy described certain safety checks that his aircraft
				does in an advertisement for them, which every other aircraft does but
				never mentions about them in their ads thinking that the customer knows.
				The result - the campaign brought the number of passengers travelling in
				the aircraft to a new record.
				<br />
				<br />
				"The more you tell, the more you sell"
				<br />
				<br />
				<span class="sub-heading sub-heading-big">
					4) The headline decides.
				</span>
				<br />
				<br />
				On average, the headline is read five times more than the body. That
				means you have already spent 80 per cent of your client's budget after
				you have written a headline. If the headline is clumsy, the campaign is
				almost a sure failure.
				<br />
				<br />
				<span class="sub-heading sub-heading-big">
					5) Include the selling promise in your headline.
				</span>
				<br />
				<br />
				Ogilvy says in order to include the selling promise in the headline, it
				requires it to be lengthy. He advises keeping the length of the headline
				somewhere between six to twelve words.
				<br />
				<br />
				He also cites a headline that he wrote for Rolls-Royce which he claims
				to be his best headline - “At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this
				new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock.”
				<br />
				<br />
				<span class="sub-heading sub-heading-big">
					6) Don't play games with the reader.
				</span>
				<br />
				<br />
				Ogilvy considers writing tricky headlines - puns, literary and allusion
				as a sin. hundreds of ads are trying to capture the reader's attention.
				The reader won't spend much energy trying to figure out the literary
				meaning in yours.
				<br />
				<br />
				<span class="sub-heading sub-heading-big">
					7) Do not use negatives.
				</span>
				<br />
				<br />
				He contempts the usage of negative words in the headline. The reader
				might connect the negative with your product. For example, if in your
				headline it is written 'OUR PRODUCT DOES NOT CONTAIN ARSENIC' the read
				might skip the 'NOT' and may read it as 'OUR PRODUCT DOES CONTAIN
				ARSENIC'.
				<br />
				<br />
				<span class="sub-heading sub-heading-big">
					8) Make the body copy as long as possible but do not beat around the
					bush.
				</span>
				<br />
				<br />
				He says to pretend that you are sitting with a pretty woman in a party
				and she asks you about which car to buy and to write body copies the way
				you would have answered. ie, never to beat around the bush and to start
				talking about the matter directly.
				<br />
				<br />
				He also emphasises the importance of having a long body copy. Research
				says that the readership drastically falls up to the first fifty words,
				but after fifty to five hundred, there is only a slight drop of readers.
				He urges to make use of the attention and to provide all the crucial
				information about the product in the body without shying away from doing
				so.
				<br />
				<br />
				<span class="sub-heading sub-heading-big">
					9) Photographs should arouse readers curiosity.
				</span>
				<br />
				<br />
				Coming to pictures in ads, he always prefers to use real images than
				cartoons or illustrations saying that humans give more attention to real
				human faces than a rendered one. The main purpose of the image is to
				drive the curiosity of the customer to the product as images capture
				attention better than anything else.
				<br />
				<br />
				<span class="sub-heading sub-heading-big">
					10) Purpose of video commercials is to sell, not to entertain.
				</span>
				<br />
				<br />
				As I have observed, there are many TV commercials that tell a beautiful
				story that strikes and stays in our minds, but it's hard for me to
				recollect for which brand or product was that video made for. This is a
				wastage of advertisement money says, Ogilvy. Always mention, rather
				start by mentioning the product in the video in order to get sales.
				<br />
				<br />
				These are only a small portion of valuable points that I got from the
				book, apart from creating ad campaigns, in the book he shares his views
				on how to get & keep clients, and how to run an agency.
				<a href="https://amzn.to/34sCnFM">The book is available on Amazon.</a>
				<br />
				<br />
				Thanks for reading :)
