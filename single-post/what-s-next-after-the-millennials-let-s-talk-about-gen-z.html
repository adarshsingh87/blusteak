				What's next, after the Millennials? Let's talk about Gen Z.
			</div>
			<p>
				We've all heard about Millennials and how different they are in terms of
				spending pattern and consumption behaviour. Well, they are in no way
				special. There has always been a shift in behavioural pattern every 20
				years or so. Since Millennials have now achieved purchasing power, and
				they are the first ones to reach that point after the onset of the
				information age, the change is being watched and analysed by the whole
				world, possibly in awe.
				<br />
				<br />
				From a marketer's perspective, this change that happens mostly in a 20
				year interval seems frustrating, because after trying on so many levels
				only the industry may 'hack' the marketing 'tactic' that may produce
				certain results, but that statistics or data may become invalid or vain
				due to the shift to the next generation and with that, the behaviour
				too.
				<br />
				<br />
				For those who are new to this whole 'Generational Segmentation', I would
				like to explain in very brief about the different segments of
				generations we have witnessed the past century [Source:
				<a href="http://wikipedia.com/">Wikipedia</a>
				]:
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog24.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>
				<span class="sub-heading">1) Baby Boomers</span>
				- defined as those individuals born between 1946 and 1964.
				<br />
				<br />
				<span class="sub-heading">2) Generation X</span>
				- Demographers and researchers typically use birth years ranging from the
				early-to-mid 1960s to the early 1980s.
				<br />
				<br />
				<span class="sub-heading">3) Millennials</span>
				- Researchers and popular media use the early 1980s as starting birth
				years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years.
				<br />
				<br />
				<span class="sub-heading">4) Generation Z</span>
				- Demographers and researchers typically use the mid-1990s to early-2000s
				as starting birth years.
				<br />
				<br />
				Currently, the thick meat for marketers lies in the Gen X and Millennial
				segments. For the sake of the length of the post and the context, I'd like
				to skip talking about Gen X and take Millennials only as the subject of
				analysis. I am noting below, only, the two main purchasing behaviours of
				those who belong to this category. [Source:
				<a

				<br />
				<br />
				<span class="sub-heading">
					1) Millennials want their purchases to make them feel good ie, they
					spend for experiences.
				</span>
				<br />
				Research has shown that more than half of Millennials purchase from a
				brand which relates to them as a person, which helps them portray
				themselves more explicitly.
				<br />
				<br />
				<span class="sub-heading">
					2) Millennials trust peer-generated endorsements.
				</span>
				<br />
				Interestingly, it has been found that they avoid paying attention to
				direct advertisements from the brands and place more belief on word of
				mouth and product reviews.
				<br />
				<br />
				All these are good data for marketers and they have been riding on it.
				But, as I've mentioned above, what next?
				<br />
				<br />
				As millennials are getting older, it has started to create a new space,
				the 20 years old window is slowly coming to an end and is opening gates
				for the new segment, the Gen Z.
				<br />
				<br />
				The new segment is only barely learning to walk, and for the same reason
				itself, they haven't exhibited sufficient patterns or traces for
				researchers to observe and to make sense out of it. But like always,
				looking backwards can help in predicting the future.
				<br />
				<br />
				No, Gen Z isn't going to study from Millennials, rather from Gen X - says
				a study done by Bloomberg. “Gen X is raising Gen Z to look like them:
				autonomous, cynical, with looser reins,” said Corey Seemiller, professor
				at Ohio’s Wright State University who has conducted research and written
				several books on Generation Z. [Source:
				<a
					href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-29/how-gen-x-parents-raised-gen-z-kids-different-than-millennials"
				>
					Bloomberg
				</a>
				]
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog24-1.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>
				The above graph is one among the strong data clusters that clarifies the
				predicted similarity in behaviour between Gen X and Gen Z.
				<br />
				<br />
				It's all good to know that Gen Z is learning form Gen X, but what's in
				it for marketers? The behavioural changes can be concluded as follows
				[Source:
				<a
					href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/how-gen-z-differs-from-millennials-4699252/"
				>
					LinkedIn
				</a>
				]
				<br />
				<br />
				1) Gen Z is tougher and more resilient than the millennial generation.
				<br />
				<br />
				2) Sees more value in education.
				<br />
				<br />
				3) Seeks financial security after witnessing those born in the 80s and
				90s incur massive debt.
				<br />
				<br />
				Alright now we do have a clarity about their behaviour, what are they
				going to spend on? (The million dollar question)
				<br />
				<br />
				And the answer is... they are going to buy.. nothing!?
				<br />
				<br />
				I may sound hideous, but that's what their behaviour predicts. Instead
				of buying pricey items, they are going to save money by renting.
				<br />
				<br />
				It's assumed that Gen Z is going to literally rent out everything - from
				real estate to clothes to furniture. Hence a new window could possibly
				open up for marketers, that is to build products or services with such
				caution that, the particular should preferably be in a subscription
				model and may be put up in a manner that can withstand changes in user
				patterns.
				<br />
				<br />
				As a marketer myself, I hope that the trend predicted withstands time so
				that we could help Gen Z choose better, worthwhile products to rent.
				<br />
				<br />
				Thanks for reading :)
