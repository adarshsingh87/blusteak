				Is the organic reach of LinkedIn going down? ‚Äì Here‚Äôs the proof
			</div>
			<p>
				I have been active on LinkedIn for over two years now. And I got my
				voice heard. I found many people who resonated with my LinkedIn posts.
			</p>
			<p>
				And my posts also reached people with whom
				<a href="../index.html">Blusteak</a>
				later worked with.
			</p>
			<p>
				But for the last few weeks, I have a nagging feeling ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe organic
				reach of LinkedIn posts is going down.‚Äù I checked with some friends;
				they felt the same. But I didn‚Äôt find definite proof.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, I went through the data I had. And ran an experiment to uncover the
				trend in the organic reach of LinkedIn.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog1-1.webp" alt="blog-img" />
			<div class="sub-heading">
				The trend in LinkedIn‚Äôs organic reach ‚Äì My experiment
			</div>
			<p>
				I picked up
				<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaisonthomas123/" target="_">
					random posts from the last two months
				</a>
				and noted down their stats. And the table below lists the statistics of
				some best performing posts when I received a good LinkedIn organic
				reach.
			</p>
			<p>
				For this experiment, I excluded those posts which reached to more than
				10,000 people.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog1-2.webp" alt="blog-data" />
			<p>
				As you can see from the data, one image post had 6000+ views, while
				another one crossed 2000 views. Then, the two text posts reached 4000+
				and 9000+ people each.
				<br />
				However, the stats from the later posts weren‚Äôt so promising.
			</p>
			<p>
				The table below lists the data of some top-performing recent posts (at
				the time of writing). Here too, I didn‚Äôt include the posts which had
				10,000+ views.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog1-3.webp" alt="blog-data" />
			<p>
				These LinkedIn posts were text posts. And as you can see, these posts
				reached to only around 1000-2000 people.
			</p>
			<p>
				A significant downfall, indeed. But don‚Äôt reach the conclusion yet. I
				dug further.
			</p>
			<p>
				i) I calculated the average reach of a bunch of posts (and not only the
				top ones). And during the time, when LinkedIn algorithm favoured my
				posts, the average reach came out to be 1322 per post.
			</p>
			<p>
				ii) Then, I averaged the reach of the recent posts. And the number was
				922 per post.
			</p>
			<p>
				iii) After that, I calculated the percentage difference. And the
				resultant number was around 31%. Yes, the average reach of my LinkedIn
				posts tipped down 30% within a matter of days.
			</p>
			<p>
				And because of the reduced reach, the user engagement in those LinkedIn
				posts suffered too. It further affected the reach. Earlier, I used to
				see engagement from many people who weren‚Äôt even connected. But with my
				recent posts, I noticed interaction from my connections and followers
				only.
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading">The probable reasons for this behaviour</div>
			<p>
				As per my observations, the following are the reasons for this changed
				behaviour of LinkedIn algorithm ‚Äì
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading">‚óè A growing number of content creators ‚Äì</div>
			<p>
				In the last few months,
				<a
					href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/linkedins-up-to-690-million-members-reports-26-growth-in-user-sessions/577067/"
					target="_"
				>
					the popularity of LinkedIn grew manifold.
				</a>
				Because of the coronavirus pandemic and country-wide lockdown, people
				began networking on LinkedIn. Many users, who weren‚Äôt active earlier,
				started posting on LinkedIn.
			</p>
			<p>
				Marketers also became active as they found LinkedIn to be the best
				social media for organic reach. And with the huge influx of posts, the
				average reach went down.
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading">‚óè Monetizing efforts by LinkedIn ‚Äì</div>
			<p>
				As more content creators joined LinkedIn, many new features were
				introduced to keep them engaged. From document sharing to videos, and
				audio messages to reactions on posts, LinkedIn made a plethora of major
				and minor developments.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a
					href="https://www.livemint.com/news/world/linkedin-introduces-stories-and-a-redesign-to-create-a-friendlier-platform-11601094853125.html"
					target="_"
				>
					Recently, it also introduced Stories.
				</a>
				And as LinkedIn saw an increase in daily log-ins, they found an
				opportunity for monetization. They reduced the reach. And now, more
				users will have to pay for LinkedIn Ads to boost their posts and reach
				their audience.
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading">Conclusion</div>
			<p>
				The organic reach of LinkedIn posts has taken a hit for sure. It might
				not be the organic social media platform it used to be. But you can
				still lead.
			</p>
			<p>
				Build your authority and interact with your community. When you offer
				value and people resonate with your posts, they‚Äôll engage and they‚Äôll
				wait for your posts. And LinkedIn algorithm changes won't be a cause of
				worry anymore.
			</p>
			<p>
				That‚Äôs all for today. I‚Äôll be back with another experiment or study
				soon. In the meantime, comment below your LinkedIn experience and what
				all you do to boost user engagements.
