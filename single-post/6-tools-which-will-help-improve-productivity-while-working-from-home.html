				6 Tools Which Will Help Improve Productivity While Working From Home
			</div>
			<p>
				In light of the Coronavirus outbreak, many businesses had to shut down
				their offices and had to resort to work from home measures. Although
				this is a necessary safety measure, the businesses cannot expect to have
				the same level of efficiency while employees are working from their
				homes. This may be due to several communication problems or certain
				network issues which the employees might face. In such situations, the
				employees can make use of certain tools available online to ensure that
				they could perform their jobs efficiently from their homes, Some of
				these are:
				<br />
				<br />
				1)
				<a
					href="https://products.office.com/en-in/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software"
				>
					Microsoft Teams
				</a>
				- It is a useful tool which enables its users to set up Teams and chat
				and communicate within these teams. If users need face to face
				conversation, then they can jump straight into voice or video chats with
				other users with a single click. Microsoft Teams is integrated with
				Microsoft Office Services such as MS Word and MS Excel.

				2)
				<a href="https://drawpile.net/">Drawpile</a>
				- This is a multimedia app which allows its users to draw on a single
				canvas simultaneously. Multiple users can use the canvas at a single
				time. The drawpile is a simple little graphics design tool having a
				built-in server by which different users can access the canvas at the
				same time.

				3)
				<a href="https://firewalla.com/">Firewalla</a>
				- Itis a powerful firewall that connects to the router and protects our
				devices from cyber attacks. It safeguards our personal and business
				data. It is a useful device in public and home networks to ensure
				maximum protection from viruses and network attacks.

			<p>
				4)
				<a href="https://www.snapchat.com/l/en-gb/">Snapchat</a>
				- Bored at home? Well, Snapchat has got you covered. Snapchat is a
				multimedia app which allows you to easily talk with friends, view live
				stories and discover the latest news. You can send snaps to your friends
				which will only last for about 10 seconds and then disappear or send
				Stories which lasts for 24 hours.
			</p>

				5)
				<a
					href="https://www.amazon.in/TP-Link-TL-WA850RE-300Mbps-Universal-Extender/dp/B00A0VCJPI"
				>
					Range Extender
				</a>
				- WiFi's in homes usually have a limited range. One may not get a
				network connection when they are in a different room away from the Wifi.
				When you are doing your office work from home, you need a really good
				network connection. To get good connectivity, we can use a Range
				extender. Range extender helps to keep your devices connected in every
				room. It provides you with a fast, reliable connection and expanded
				coverage in every corner of your home.

				6)
				<a href="https://wfh.ninja/">Work From Home Excuse Generator</a>
				- Suppose you woke up a little late for work. You look at the clock and
				you realised that your office has started. You know that you can't reach
				there on time. What do you do? Well, go to the website wth.ninja. This
				site provides you with a variety of excuses which you can use to present
				to your boss thus enabling you to Work From Home.
