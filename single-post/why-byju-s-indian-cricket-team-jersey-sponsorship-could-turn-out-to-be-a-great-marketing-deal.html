				Why Byju's Indian Cricket Team Jersey Sponsorship Could Turn Out to be a
				Great Marketing Deal
			</div>
			<p>
				It was all over the business news, on social media and in any platforms
				where marketing could be critiqued. I have read both the sides of the
				arguments with a pre-judged notion in my mind, and I'm pointing out some
				of the versions of my ideas telling me that Byju's indeed did a good
				marketing game. Here are them:
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog25.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>
				1) My strong point here is
				<span style="font-weight: bold">credibility</span>
				. I'll be explaining how Byju's could get strong credibility points &
				why it could be crucial for their type of business through the following
				points.
				<br />
				<br />
				2)
				<span style="font-weight: bold">Reach</span>
				: An estimated 400 million watch cricket on television in India, which
				is almost impossible to replicate through any other media.
				<br />
				<br />
				3)
				<span style="font-weight: bold">Target Group:</span>
				I don't think students are the real target group here, I'd say parents
				of school going students are their real customers. To reach them, Indian
				Cricket jersey is a good choice.
				<br />
				<br />
				4)
				<span style="font-weight: bold">Method of sales</span>
				: From my research, Byju's initially generate leads through various
				platform such as Whatsapp and other online and offline medias and then
				proceed to cold calling the target group. And since our target group is
				parents, they would get turned down if they haven't heard of the brand
				from a trusted source which India Team jersey can provide unlike social
				media platforms where fake contents are being heavily criticised.
				<br />
				<br />
				5)
				<span style="font-weight: bold">Penetration</span>
				: Moving to capture an even bigger market, Biju's need to penetrate into
				tier 2 Indian cities rather than just moving about only in metropolitan
				cities. Cricket has the unique feature of equally penetrating almost all
				sectors of the population.
				<br />
				<br />
				6)
				<span style="font-weight: bold">Exclusivity</span>
				: This is one of the biggest reasons why I support Byju's for their
				decision. Unlike paying online influencers or promoting through online
				platforms, there is only one brand name that will have a spot in front
				of team India's jersey. It itself enhances the trust factor for the
				brand.
				<br />
				<br />
				7)
				<span style="font-weight: bold">Familiarity</span>
				: The starting paid scheme of Byju's is around 30k Rupees. Any tier 2
				city parent who would consider buying this package for their child must
				be familiar about the app & brand. Doing a 3 year branding on Indian
				Team jersey can exponentially increase familiarity with no doubt.
				<br />
				<br />
				Although I couldn't find the exact amount for the sponsorship, comparing
				it with OPPO's previous costing of
				<span style="font-weight: bold">1079 Crore Rupees</span>
				, It is one hell of a deal and if it doesn't hit the point as I think it
				would, It would do some great damage to the startup.
