				</a>
				recently. For me, whenever I see a new filter, I get excited to try it
				out and to think about why it is resonating with the users.
			</p>
			<p>
				Recently, my friend Dimple Meera Jom who is leading the team which
				manages the
				<a href="https://www.instagram.com/di_writers/?hl=en">
					Instagram account "Di_writers"
				</a>
				came up with a very interesting AR filter which went on to get more than
				1 Million impressions on Instagram
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog6-1.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>
				Hence I decided to reach out to her to pick her brain in order to let
				you all know how you too can possibly bring up a viral AR effect on your
				Instagram.
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading">
				CASE STUDY: How to create a viral AR filter - "The Mariage Predictor"
				story on how it went on to reach more than 1 Million impressions on
				Instagram.
			</div>
			<div class="sub-heading">What's the filter is all about:</div>
			<p>
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH_sg17pxMY">
					It's basically a random marriage predictor
				</a>
				which will stop at any of the 6 imaginary scenarios which predict how
				your love life is going to end up in. Exciting right? (Malayalam
				Language is used since the account is from Kerala. "Kalyanam" means
				Marriage in Malayalam )
			</p>

			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				1) Picking the topic: Go after something that's catching eyeballs
				already
			</div>
			<p>
				You might have seen the
				<a
					href="https://www.republicworld.com/technology-news/apps/coffin-dance-videos-instagram-filter-viral-guide-how-to-do-it-yourself.html"
				>
					AR filter based out of the "Coffin Dance Meme"
				</a>
				. What that creator did was to take-up something that was already viral
				on the internet and to create an AR version for it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Just like that Dimple picked a
				<a href="http://flamesgame.appspot.com/">
					Just like that Dimple picked a popular game among Keralites called
					"FLAMES/SOLAR" Just like that Dimple picked a
				</a>
				(Sanyasam, Olichottam, Love Marriage, Arrange Marriage, Register
				Marriage) and developed the AR version for it. I mean who wouldn't want
				to test that out!
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog6-3.webp" alt="img" />
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				2) Audience: You better know them in & out.
			</div>
			<i>
				"I was pretty sure that my audience would try this digital version of
				marriage prediction!!"
				<br />
				- Dimple
			</i>
			<p>
				She already enjoys more than 20,000 followers on her Instagram account.
				She knew what exactly would her audience want as an AR filter. My guess
				is that the topic of marriage is very much discussed among females and
				that's what her majority audience was too!
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				3) It should go well with your brand.
			</div>
			<i>
				"I've made sure to stick to our branding while creating the AR, I guess
				it will have a positive impact"
			</i>
			<p>
				Dimple wanted the AR filter to have all the elements of her brand
				Di_writers. It's humorous & light in tone. The colour palette as you can
				see is yellow which is the primary colour of Di_writers and she also
				placed the face and the mascot of her brand - The "DiWriter girl" in all
				those prediction cards.
			</p>
			<p>
				For me, this is a crucial part. If you don't integrate your brand into
				the AR filter, you gain pretty much nothing even if the filter goes
				viral.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog6-4.webp" alt="img" />
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				4) Making it viral: the process
			</div>
			<p>
				Just like anything, the result doesn't come to you, you have to get
				yourself to it. And it takes energy and strategy. Initially, she created
				hype on her Instagram by telling a humorous story which grabbed the
				attention of her followers.
			</p>
			<img
				loading="lazy"
				src="../assets/blogs/blog6-5.webp"
				alt="img"
				class="sub-img"
			/>
			<p>
				In Malayalam, she brilliantly gets the whole story across to the
				audience by mixing her personal perspective and humour.
			</p>
			<p>
				It translates to "Try out the effect directly from the profile. I
				finished creating this effect 3 am last night! This shows my dedication
				to understanding how your marriage is going to be!"
			</p>
			<p>
				Never use the same old corporate gibberish to promote anything on social
				media! You have to be yourself!
			</p>
			<p>
				Her whole team shared it on their profiles which might also have helped
				in reaching more audience initially. This is something that many brands
				miss. If you're running a campaign, you and your team should be the ones
				who should be participating before anyone else!
			</p>
			<p>
				It didn't take much time after that to see that filter go viral. Within
				5 days time, the filter got more than 1 Million impressions.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog6-6.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>
				In a few days time, the filter was also being shared by huge celebrities
				in Kerala ranging from Sania Iyyappan to Diya Krishna.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog6-7.png" alt="img" />
			<p>
				All credit goes to Dimple and her team for grabbing the opportunity that
				Instagram AR provides early on.
			</p>
			<p>
				I hope this small case study will help you or your brand to launch a
				successful AR filter campaign which pretty well might be the thing for
				the days to come.
