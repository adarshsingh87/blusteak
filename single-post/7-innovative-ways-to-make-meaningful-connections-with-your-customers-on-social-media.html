				7 Innovative Ways To Make Meaningful Connections With Your Customers On
				Social Media
			</div>
			<p>
				We are surrounded by technology so much that we crave for actual
				communication with authentic people. We go on a website and we see a bot
				trying to interact with us. We type a reply on LinkedIn and we see AI
				giving us suggestions about our reply even before we start typing.
				Technology is amazing, it has made lives simpler, but it has reduced the
				actual human connection.
			</p>
			<p>
				How many people do you think actively search for a brand on social media
				to see what they have put up? Few, right? This is because of their
				monotonous messaging that lacks the human touch. Even though the message
				is shared by a human, it still sounds robotic because of the way it is
				communicated.
			</p>
			<p>
				Establish a relationship with your brand that encourages individuals to
				actively look forward to your communication via social media, website
				and any other communication channel. This can be achieved by Humanising
				your brand. Humanising your brand means adding that element of
				familiarity, a sense of belonging and relatability to your brand.

				7 Tips To Connect With Your Customers At A Human Level
			</div>
			<div class="sub-heading">1. Your people are your assets</div>
			<p>
				As much cliché as it may sound, it is true. Your employees, your
				customers, and every single human being that your brand is associated
				with can give you traffic. Everybody in this digital age has a social
				media profile, and when you encourage people to talk actively about you
				on social media, they become advocates of your brand. When an employee
				or customer promotes you, people are more likely to trust you than, when
				you would have reached them through any other way.
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading">2. In house influencer</div>
			<p>
				Brands spend an exorbitant amount of money on influencer marketing. But,
				they fail to pay attention to the influencers in the house who are
				recognised by the media, like the CEO or CFO of the organisation.
				Leveraging the audience of your in-house influencer is one of the
				significant ways to humanise your brand.

			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading">3. Build a Community</div>
			<p>
				Building a community around your product is the best thing that you can
				probably do. Because, the larger the community, the better your brand's
				reach. Your community members are the people who are loyal to your
				brand. The community acts as an engaging group of individuals who strive
				to help each other. One such example is Air bnb. They have a dedicated
				section for hosts where they can share their travel stories, tips &
				tricks & destination details.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog3-2.webp" alt="img" />
			<div class="sub-heading">4. Share Stories</div>
			<p>
				Storytelling, as we all know, is by far one of the finest ways to
				connect with your audience. Tell people how your product helped people
				to solve their problems. Share client testimonials in the form of
				stories.
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading">5. Add faces to your Brand</div>
			<p>
				Stop using stock photos on your website! Stock photos don’t add that
				relatability factor. It is much better to use actual photographs of your
				employees. Show those smiling faces to the world. It helps people to
				sense transparency from your brand, which in turn helps them to see your
				brand as something more than your logo. Only then they will start to
				recognise you as a community.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog3-3.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>
				<a href="http://privy.com/" target="_">Privy.com</a>
				has used their own faces to build reliability and trust in their brand.
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading">6. Talk to your customers</div>
			<p>
				Actively jump into discussions about your brand. Try to talk to people
				when they post about your brand, even if it is a negative review or
				rant, try to understand them and offer a solution. This assures people
				that you are listening to them and actively responding to their
				feedback. Also, it gives them a sense of happiness when they get that
				sweet message from their brand, and they don’t feel like there is nobody
				on the other side of the screen.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog3-4.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>
				How smartly KFC used this negative tweet to promote their upcoming
				launch of 'better fries' is epic! It simply confirms that for a clever
				marketer any comment is a good comment and how important to jump into a
				conversation with your clients wherever they hang out.
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading">7. Have fun with your Brand</div>
			<p>
				Staying relevant is one of the major problems faced by brands. This can
				easily be overcome if they add a pinch of relevant humour to their
				communication. Humour encourages people to engage with your content. It
				also enables people to see you as not just a business focused on selling
				their product, but also a fun human. Netflix has been doing an excellent
				job of adding humour to their communication.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog3-5.webp" alt="img" />
			<div class="sub-heading">Conclusion:</div>
			<p>
				You need to think from the shoes of the customer, how you can make each
				and every interaction with them more human. People love to see that your
				brand is also very relatable and portrays in a very approachable manner.
