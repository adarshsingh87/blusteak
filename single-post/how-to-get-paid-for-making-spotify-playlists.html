				How to Get Paid for Making Spotify Playlists?
			</div>
			<p>
				Most of us have a Spotify playlist, right? Have you ever thought about
				monetizing it?
				<br />
				<br />
				What if I told you that you can get paid for listening to music!
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog8-1.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>
				Yes, you can. There is a method which can actually provide you with a
				stream of income from building a great playlist.

				<br />
				<br />

				</a>

				<br />
				<br />
				Don’t think that Spotify is going to send you money directly for the
				number of likes you get on your playlist. There is no official program
				from Spotify yet for this.

				<br />
				<br />
				You have to think about how beneficial it would be for an emerging
				artist if his/her track gets featured in your playlist. Most of the
				listeners of your playlist is going to hear that new track too, which
				means the artist is going to get more streams which he/she will not be
				getting otherwise.
				<br />
				<br />

				And for reviewing the song, you can charge the artist a fixed rate and
				only if you like the track you may publish it. Always put the focus on
				keeping the quality of your playlist top. Don’t spam it with promotions.
				Users are going to leave and you may no longer have the business model
				intact.

				</a>

				<br />
				<br />
				I’ll take you through an example:
				<br />
				<br />

				Imagine this is your playlist, you collect all awesome tracks for
				writers to help them focus and to get them into the mood.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog8-2.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>
				Now you are getting thousands of daily streams for your playlist. You
				have done your work, keeping the quality high.

				<br />
				<br />
				It’s time for you to think about making money out of it.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog8-3.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>
				You have to give a contact point such as an email or an Instagram
				username so that artists can actually reach you.

				<br />
				<br />
				There are platforms such as
				<a href="https://playlistpush.com/curators/">PlaylistPush</a>
				which can make this process a lot easier by listing your playlist in
				their directory where artists come for searching for quality playlists
				to get featured in. You’ll get paid per review request there.
				<br />
				<br />

				Now, select the best records that you think suits your playlist the best
				and add it to your playlist.
				<br />
				<br />

				Voila! You earn from it, and you help an emerging artist grow their
				career in the process.
				<br />
				<br />

				Thanks for reading!
