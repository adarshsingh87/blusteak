				Familiarity principle is the tendency of humans to have a better
				preference for the things that they are more familiar with.
				<br />
				<br />
				I saw an interesting real-life story that can explain it better:
				"my[author's] dog was scared of the hoover the first time it came out,
				and he refused to leave the house when it snowed in his first winter
				with us. "
				<br />
				<br />
				It is an example that most of the animals fear or try to hide/run away
				from unfamiliar things, but tends to overcome the fear if it becomes
				regular/familiar as time passes by.
				<br />
				<br />
				Just like this analogy, when it comes to consumer behaviour, people tend
				to "trust" products which they have seen before more than a new product
				with zero familiarity, even if the new product may be of higher quality.
				<br />
				<br />
				How can businesses achieve this?
				<br />
				<br />
				By portraying a consistent personality for their brands through whatever
				elements the brand uses to communicate to the audiences. It might be
				Logos, fonts, Tone of voice, colour palette, the images that the brand
				uses etc..
				<br />
				<br />
				Having a long term strategy and consistently communicating the same with
				your audiences is what makes an organisation a brand.
