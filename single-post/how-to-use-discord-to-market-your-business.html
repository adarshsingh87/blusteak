      How to Use Discord to Market Your Business?
    </div>
    <p>Discord has particularly been popular among gamers. But over the years the use <a target="_" href="https://blog.discord.com/your-place-to-talk-a7ffa19b901b">exploded among other people</a> too. From art
    and music to economy and politics, Discord has led to the growth of many communities. And you can use Discord for your
    business too.
    <br>
    <br>
    So, in this article, I’m listing the business benefits of Discord and how you can use it to market your business.
    <br>
    <br>
    Let’s dive in.
</p>
    <img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/discord-dp.jpeg" alt="blog-img" />
    <p>
      <span class="sub-heading-big">What is Discord?</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      Discord is a real-time chat platform where gamers, influencers and anyone, who has built a community, can engage. Users
      can join different servers through exclusive invites and can interact with other community members on dedicated
      channels.
      <br>
      <br>
      For example, the management can chat within their channel, while your production department can have a separate one. And
      the sales team will have their own.
      <br>
      <br>
      You can also have a channel for company-wide announcements. Discord is one of the most useful tools for your business.

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="sub-heading-big">Business benefits of using Discord</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <sapn class="sub-heading">1. Discord provides better control over the members</sapn>
      <br>
      <br>
      People need a custom invite link to join your Discord server. So, your community has a lesser chance to be flocked by
      trolls and spammers.
      <br>
      <br>
      Also, server administrators can delete messages and ban members who abuse the rules. And they can add moderators to
      manage the community and its members.
      <br>
      <br>
      Discord itself has a strict usage policy. <a target="_" href='https://blog.discord.com/discord-transparency-report-jan-june-2020-2ef4a3ee346d'>And it banned over 4 million accounts for spamming</a>, in the first half of 2020.
      <br>
      <br>
      <sapn class="sub-heading">2. Discord is quicker than emails</sapn>
      <br>
      <br>
      Email is irreplaceable, I know. But it is also cumbersome at times.
      <br>
      <br>
      Just imagine a situation, when you forgot some instructions, and it is lost among the emails. And when you misplaced the
      emailed image or video needed for the social media post.
      <br>
      <br>
      In such cases, Discord could have been a savior.
      <br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/discord-2.jpeg" alt="blog-img" />
    <p>
      <span class='sub-heading'>3. Discord is like an algorithm-free feed</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      Discord is, basically, a chat messenger. And its feed is independent of any algorithm.
      <br>
      <br>
      So, whether to announce an update, launch a product or send an event invite, drop it in the dedicated channel.
      <br>
      <br>
      Discord lists each message chronologically. And no one will lose a company announcement.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      
      <span class='sub-heading-big'>Five ways to use Discord to market your business</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class='sub-heading'>1. Build a moderated community</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      Apart from internal communications, you can create a Discord server as a moderated social discussion platform. Create
      different channels depending on what your target audience might like to discuss. And let them bond together.
      <br>
      <br>
      Create a text channel to discuss books, movies or adventures, whatever seems relevant to your business and target
      audience. You can even start a voice/video channel if needed.
      <br>
      <br>
      And as your community grows, the popularity of your business will spread too. Word-of-mouth Marketing is still powerful.

      <br>
      <br>
      <span class='sub-heading'>2. Find new channels with like-minded individuals</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      Along with building your community, you can also meet other like-minded individuals in different Discord servers.
      <br>
      <br>
      It’s easy to find relevant servers once you know what you're looking for. Ask your team members, check with your
      community, and join those groups.
      <br>
      <br>
      There, you'll meet other business owners and grab opportunities for collaborations. And it will also help you get your
      products and services to more people from your target audience.
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class='sub-heading'>3. Share articles and relevant industry content</span>
    </p>
    <img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/discord-1.jpeg" alt="blog-img" />
    <p>
      Yes, you can use Discord to share your website articles and other updates from your industry.
      <br>
      <br>
      As all employees are connected on a single server, you can leverage their social media presence. They’ll share the
      articles on other Discord servers and their personal social media profiles to increase its reach.
      <br>
      <br>
      It will help you develop authority among your target audience.
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class='sub-heading'>4. Post branded memes and image-based content</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      Posting branded memes, GIFs and funny screenshots are yet another way to market your business. And Discord could be
      mighty helpful.
      <br>
      <br>
      It’s more like a chat app, and it’s independent of any algorithm. So, whenever you post any content on your business
      server or the community server, every member will get it.
      <br>
      <br>
      So, design relevant (and share-worthy) memes and share them on Discord.

      <br>
      <br>
      <span class='sub-heading'>5. Offer quick customer service</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      And at last, use a dedicated Discord server to handle customer complaints.
      <br>
      <br>
      People want quick service, and since Discord messages come in real-time, you can address the concerns right away. You
      can easily send direct messages and have private conversations with the members.
      <br>
      <br>
      And you can also <a href="https://zapier.com/apps/discord/integrations" target="_">use Zapier to connect Discord to other customer service media</a> you use.
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class='sub-heading-big'>Wrapping it up</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      Although Discord is primarily an app for real-time communication among individuals, it also offers many benefits to
      businesses.
      <br>
      <br>
      And you can use Discord to market your business too.
      <br>
      <br>
      Build a community, meet like-minded individuals, and provide quick customer service. And it’s all available for free.
