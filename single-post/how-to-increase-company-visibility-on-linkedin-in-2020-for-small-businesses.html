				to it when it comes to

					lead generation in B2B

				.

				<br />
				<br />
				Since B2B is nothing more than Human to Human,
				<a

				>
					Since B2B is nothing more than Human to Human, you need to optimise
					your company's Linkedin profile Since B2B is nothing more than Human
					to Human,
				</a>
				to the best for letting the decision-makers know what exactly are they
				can expect from your business.
				<br />
				<br />

				But first of all, you need other people to discover your company page
				right?
				<br />
				For that you can go through the following 10 tips which will help in
				improving your Linkedin Company page's visibility drastically:
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				1) Have a strong personal Linkedin profile & mention your company page
				in your posts.
			</div>
			<p>
				If you are the Founder/Partner/Executive of your business, you have to
				leverage your connections on Linkedin and have to let your audience know
				about your company page.

				<br />
				<br />
				You don't have to shove it up to their face. Please don't spam their
				chat or their feed with your company page.
				<br />
				<br />

				All you have to do is to tag your company profile while you're telling
				an interesting story that has something to do with your company. If
				people really like the story that you're telling, it's a high chance
				that they'll give the page a visit and who knows, may click the follow
				button too!
				<br />
				<br />

				>
					Read this blog by Gary Vaynerchuk on How to story tell via Social
					Media
				</a>
				<br />
				<br />

				Here is an example of how I leverage my personal account to improve my
				company, Blusteak Media's Linkedin page visibility:
			</p>
			<img
				loading="lazy"
				src="../assets/blogs/blog10-1.webp"
				alt="img"
				class="sub-img"
			/>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				2) Invite your connections to follow your company page
			</div>
			<p>
				Linkedin now sometimes allows you to
				<a href="https://youtu.be/phwRVPfRDdQ">
					invite your connections to follow your company page.
				</a>

				<br />
				<br />
				Somewhere between 20 to 25 people you can invite at once. And weirdly
				enough, Linkedin takes away the feature for sometime after you invite
				your connections. I see that after about 2 weeks or 3 weeks time, it
				reappears.
			</p>
			<img
				loading="lazy"
				src="../assets/blogs/blog10-2.webp"
				alt="img"
				class="sub-img"
			/>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				3) Use SEO to your advantage
			</div>
			<p>
				This might surprise you, but from what I experienced, Google loves to
				rank your company's Linkedin page. You have to be very careful in
				writing the company's about section. Make it SEO friendly including all
				your selected keywords.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog10-3.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>
				In addition, Google also scraps content from the posts on your company
				page. Therefore don't feel lazy to add more text content to your posts.
				Also, add ALT text to all the images that you're posting.

				<br />
				<br />
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUIj_Px1lFM">
					[Video] How to add alt text in Linkedin posts
				</a>
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				4) Study your analytics & improve upon it
			</div>
			<p>
				Linkedin shows four main metrics as the key performance indexes, ie.
				Unique visitors, New followers, Post impressions and Custom button
				clicks.
			</p>
			<img
				loading="lazy"
				src="../assets/blogs/blog10-4.webp"
				alt="img"
				class="sub-img"
			/>
			<p>
				One math you always have to calculate is the conversion percentage which
				can be formulated by dividing the new followers with unique visitors and
				then multiplying the result with 100. Try to keep the conversion ratio
				above 20%. If you are not getting that result, try changing your cover
				picture, bio and posting strategy.

				<br />
				<br />
				For visibility, the sole metric is post impressions. To increase post
				impressions, apart from those who already follow your company you can
				ask your employees to engage with the posts by commenting, re-sharing
				and reacting to it. This will help the post to reach across their
				connections too.
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				5) Have a warm & welcoming cover picture
			</div>
			<p>
				As said in the above point, your cover picture can be a factor in giving
				your company it's the first impression to the visitors. We all know
				people judge a book by its cover.

				<br />
				<br />
				Some ideas to make it better is by integrating your employees into the
				picture, by listing your top testimonies in the picture or by putting up
				a clear & short vision statement of your company in the cover picture.

				<br />
				<br />
				Have a look at
				<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/canva/">
					Canva's cover picture:
				</a>
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog10-5.webp" alt="img" />
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				6) Document all the milestones & activities that are happening in the
				Company
			</div>
			<p>
				There is this one
				<a href="https://buffer.com/library/instagram-growth">
					big co-relation between the spike in followers, connections and
					subscribers to the number of content you are producing on that
					platform.
				</a>
				If it's Youtube, the more number of videos that you are putting out on
				youtube, the more chances are there for increasing the number of
				subscribers.

				<br />
				<br />
				Just like that, I have seen the same coming into action for Linkedin
				too. The more quantity you put in, the more people going to find your
				company.
				<br />
				<br />

				One hack for getting out maximum content is by "Documenting". It is
				nothing but recording all the minor and major activities and
				achievements in the company on the Linkedin page.
				<br />
				<br />

				For example, it can be about the birthday of an employee to the
				experience of the co-founder who went for a keynote session.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog10-6.webp" alt="img" />
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				7) Resharing articles that are related to your industry which can
				provide your audience value
			</div>
			<p>
				Yes, there could be times when you do not have content to "Document"
				like when there is nothing special happening in the company. In those
				times you can adopt this "Filler" technique that I use which seems to be
				working good.

				<br />
				<br />
				The thing is to reshare articles or pieces of content related to your
				industry which can provide new insights to your audience. For example,
				if you're an SEO company you can reshare articles from Moz with an
				opinionated description coming from your part.

				<br />
				<br />
				If you are furiously using this little trick you are going to be a
				content aggregator in your niche. Hence, people might give your company
				a visit in order to get updates from several different sources.

				<br />
				<br />
				You can use
				<a href="http://quora.com/">Quora for getting content for resharing.</a>
			</p>
			<img
				loading="lazy"
				src="../assets/blogs/blog10-7.webp"
				alt="img"
				class="sub-img"
			/>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				8) Comment as your Company page on "Trending posts"
			</div>
			<p>
				Linkedin will give you notifications when there are some trending posts
				appears in the hashtags you follow. Take advantage of the attention that
				Linkedin is pouring on that content and comment on something very unique
				and insightful.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../assets/blogs/blog10-8.webp" alt="img" />
			<p>
				From my experience, a huge chunk of people who engage with the content
				comes down to read the comments too. Just like any other social
				platform, commenting is a golden ticket for getting free exposure.
			</p>
			<img
				loading="lazy"
				src="../assets/blogs/blog10-9.webp"
				alt="img"
				class="sub-img"
			/>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				9) Add LinkedIn company page link in your E-mail signatures & in About
				the author notes
			</div>
			<p>
				Leverage your E-mail signatures by adding links to your company's
				Linkedin profile. Chances are that if the receiver gets curious about
				your company, she might give a look at your company page.

				<br />
				<br />
				Just like that, if you are a guest blogger or if you're company has an
				active blog, make sure to add a link to your company's LinkedIn page so
				that readers can navigate through it & eventually gain you a follower
				too.

				<br />
				<br />
				You can use these
				<a href="https://sumo.com/stories/email-signature-examples">
					templates to drive more traffic not only to Linkedin but anywhere else
				</a>
			</p>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">
				10) Ask interns, collaborators and everyone else to mention your company
				account when writing about the company on Linkedin
			</div>
			<p>
				Surely a lot of people are going to write about the experience they had
				with your company, let it be an intern or an ex-employee. If you come to
				know about this, kindly ask them a small favour of tagging your company
				profile in their story. Like I've said before, it is a good story,
				people are going to check out your company page.
			</p>
			<img
				loading="lazy"
				src="../assets/blogs/blog10-10.webp"
				alt="img"
				class="sub-img"
			/>
			<div class="sub-heading-big sub-heading">Conclusion:</div>
			<p>
				Basically all you have to do it be focused on building a human-centric
				story around your company in and around Linkedin. And of course, while
				starting off, don't be shy of asking people for collaboration and help -
				without it, traction is almost impossible.
